# Hello Video Agora for Unity

This tutorial enables you to quickly get started with using a sample app to develop requests to the Agora Gaming SDK in [Unity 3D](https://unity3d.com).

This sample app demonstrates the basic Agora SDK feature:

- [Join a Channel](#create-the-join-method)
- [Leave a Channel](#create-the-leave-method)


## Prerequisites
- Agora.io Developer Account
- Unity 3D 5.5+


## Quick Start
This section shows you how to prepare and build the Agora React Native wrapper for the sample app.

### Create an Account and Obtain an App ID
To build and run the sample application you must obtain an App ID:

1. Create a developer account at [agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/). Once you finish the signup process, you will be redirected to the Dashboard.
2. Navigate in the Dashboard tree on the left to **Projects** > **Project List**.
3. Copy the App ID that you obtained from the Dashboard into a text file. You will use this when you launch the app.

### Update and Run the Sample Application

1. Edit the [`Assets/HelloUnityVideo.cs`](Assets/HelloUnityVideo.cs) file. In the `HelloUnityVideo` class declaration, update `#YOUR APP ID#` with your App ID.

	`private static string appId = #YOUR APP ID#;`

2. Download the [Agora Gaming SDK](https://www.agora.io/en/download/) for Unity 3D.

	![download.jpg](images/download.jpg)

3. Unzip the downloaded SDK package and copy the files from the following SDK folders into the associated sample application folders.

SDK Folder|Application Folder
---|---
`libs/Android/`|`Assets/Plugins/Android/`
`libs/iOS/`|`Assets/Plugins/iOS/`
`libs/Scripts/AgoraGamingSDK/`|`Assets/Scripts/AgoraGamingSDK/`

4. Open the project in Unity and run the sample application.

## Steps to Create the Sample

The sample application is comprised of two main classes, `HelloUnityVideo` and `Home`.

- [Create the Scenes](#create-the-scenes)
- [Create the HelloUnityVideo Class](#create-the-hellounityvideo-class)
- [Create the Home Class](#create-the-home-class)

### Create the Scenes

The sample application consists of two main Unity scenes.

#### Create SceneHelloVideo

When you load `SceneHelloVideo` in Unity, you'll see that the stage contains a cylindrical object and a cube object.

![SceneHelloVideo.jpg](images/SceneHelloVideo.jpg)

The scene also contains a **Leave** button.

**Note:** You may have to zoom out and adjust the camera view to see the **Leave** button in the stage.

![SceneHelloVideo2.jpg](images/SceneHelloVideo2.jpg)

#### Create SceneHome

When you load `SceneHome` in Unity, you will see the stage contains:

UI object|Description
---|---
Text object|Explanation text for the user to read
Text input box|Text input box for the user to enter the channel name
**Join** button|Button to join the channel

**Note:** You may have to zoom out and adjust the camera view to see the leave button in the stage.

![SceneHome.jpg](images/SceneHome.jpg)

### Create the HelloUnityVideo Class

The `HelloUnityVideo` class is a subclass of `MonoBehaviour`. The [`HelloUnityVideo.cs`](Assets/HelloUnityVideo.cs) file contains the relevant Agora SDK code for the Unity 3D sample application.

```
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using agora_gaming_rtc;
using UnityEngine.UI;

public class HelloUnityVideo : MonoBehaviour {

	...

}
```

The remaining code in this section is contained within the `HelloUnityVideo` class declaration.

- [Declare Global Variables](#declare-global-variables)
- [Load / Unload Engine Methods](#load-unload-engine-methods)
- [Join / Leave Channel Methods](#join-leave-channel-methods)
- [Create General Event Listeners](#create-general-event-listeners)
- [Create User Event Listeners](#create-user-event-listeners)


#### Declare Global Variables

The `HelloUnityVideo` class has three global variables and one method that acts as a declaration for the SDK version constant.

The `appId` variable is initialized with the Agora App ID from your Agora Dashboard.

**Note:** `#YOUR APP ID#` must be replaced with a valid Agora App ID.

```
	// PLEASE KEEP THIS App ID IN SAFE PLACE
	// Get your App ID at https://dashboard.agora.io/.
	// After you entered the App ID, remove ## outside of Your App ID.
	private static string appId = #YOUR APP ID#;
```

Declare the `mRtcEngine` variable, which represents the Agora RTC engine for the application.

Initialize `mRemotePeer` to `0` which will track the index of the current remove user for the application.

```
	// instance of agora engine
	public IRtcEngine mRtcEngine;

	// implement engine callbacks

	public uint mRemotePeer = 0; // insignificant. only record one peer
```

The `getSdkVersion()` method returns the SDK version from the Agora RTC engine using `IRtcEngine.GetSdkVersion()`.

```
	public string getSdkVersion () {
		return IRtcEngine.GetSdkVersion ();
	}
```

#### Load / Unload Engine Methods

The `HelloUnityVideo` class has two methods for loading / unloading the Agora RTC engine.

##### Create the Load Engine Method

The `loadEngine()` method initializes the Agora RTC engine.

1. Set debugging logs for the method initialization and if `mRtcEngine` is not `null`. If `mRtcEngine` exists, execute a `return` as the RTC engine has already been initialized.

2. Initialize the engine with the `appId` using `IRtcEngine.getEngine()`.

3. Enable Agora logging by setting the following log filters using `mRtcEngine.SetLogFilter()`.

Filter|Description
---|---
`LOG_FILTER.DEBUG`|Sets the Agora debugging logs
`LOG_FILTER.INFO`|Sets the Agora information logs
`LOG_FILTER.WARNING`|Sets the Agora warning logs
`LOG_FILTER.ERROR`|Sets the Agora error logs
`LOG_FILTER.CRITICAL`|Sets the Agora critical error logs

```
	// load agora engine
	public void loadEngine()
	{
		// start sdk
		Debug.Log ("initializeEngine");

		if (mRtcEngine != null) {
			Debug.Log ("Engine exists. Please unload it first!");
			return;
		}

		// init engine
		mRtcEngine = IRtcEngine.getEngine (appId);

		// enable log
		mRtcEngine.SetLogFilter (LOG_FILTER.DEBUG | LOG_FILTER.INFO | LOG_FILTER.WARNING | LOG_FILTER.ERROR | LOG_FILTER.CRITICAL);
	}
```

##### Create the Unload Engine Method

The `unloadEngine()` method destroys the Agora RTC engine.

1. Set debugging logs for the method initialization.

2. Ensure `mRtcEngine` is not `null` before destroying the engine using `IRtcEngine.Destroy()` and setting `mRtcEngine` to `null`.

```
	// unload agora engine
	public void unloadEngine()
	{
		Debug.Log ("calling unloadEngine");

		// delete
		if (mRtcEngine != null) {
			IRtcEngine.Destroy ();
			mRtcEngine = null;
		}
	}
```

#### Join / Leave Channel Methods

The `HelloUnityVideo` class has two methods to manage joining and leaving a channel.

##### Create the Join Method

The `join()` method joins the user to the specified `channel`, sets event listeners, and configures the Agora RTC engine settings.

1. Set a debug log for the `channel` name using `Debug.Log()` and ensure `mRtcEngine` is not `null` before executing the remaining code for the method.

2. Set the following callbacks for `mRtcEngine`:

	**Note:** These callbacks are optional for the sample application, but are useful for extending the functionality of the application.

Event Listener|Method Value|Description
---|---|---
`OnJoinChannelSuccess`|`onJoinChannelSuccess`|Detects when the channel is successfully joined.
`OnUserJoined`|`onUserJoined`|Detects when a user successfully joins the channel.
`OnUserOffline`|`onUserOffline`|Detects when a user goes offline.

3. Enable video and set its callback using `mRtcEngine.EnableVideo()` and `mRtcEngine.EnableVideoObserver()`.

4. Join the channel using `mRtcEngine.JoinChannel()`.

5. Set a debug log for the method completion using `Debug.Log()`.

```
	public void join(string channel)
	{
		Debug.Log ("calling join (channel = " + channel + ")");

		if (mRtcEngine == null)
			return;

		// set callbacks (optional)
		mRtcEngine.OnJoinChannelSuccess = onJoinChannelSuccess;
		mRtcEngine.OnUserJoined = onUserJoined;
		mRtcEngine.OnUserOffline = onUserOffline;

		// enable video
		mRtcEngine.EnableVideo();

		// allow camera output callback
		mRtcEngine.EnableVideoObserver();

		// join channel
		mRtcEngine.JoinChannel(channel, null, 0);

		Debug.Log ("initializeEngine done");
	}
```

##### Create the Leave Method

The `leave()` method exits the user to the current channel.

1. Set a debug log to track the method call using `Debug.Log()` and ensure `mRtcEngine` is not `null` before executing the remaining code for the method.

2. Leave the channel using `mRtcEngine.LeaveChannel()`.

3. Unregister the frame observers using `mRtcEngine.DisableVideoObserver()`.

```
	public void leave()
	{
		Debug.Log ("calling leave");

		if (mRtcEngine == null)
			return;

		// leave channel
		mRtcEngine.LeaveChannel();
		// deregister video frame observers in native-c code
		mRtcEngine.DisableVideoObserver();
	}
```

#### Create General Event Listeners

The `HelloUnityVideo` class has two event listeners to manage video loading and transform events.

##### Create the Video Loaded Event Listener

The `onSceneHelloVideoLoaded()` delegate method detects when the scene loads.

Set `go` to the `GameObject` with the name `Cylinder`.

- If `go` is `null`, set a debug log for the missing `GameObject` using `Debug.Log()` and end the method execution.

- If `go` is not `null`

	1. Create a new `VideoSurface` object using  `go.GetComponent<VideoSurface> ()`.
	2. Add `onTransformDelegate` to the existing  `o.mAdjustTransfrom` value.

```
	// accessing GameObject in Scnene1
	// set video transform delegate for statically created GameObject
	public void onSceneHelloVideoLoaded()
	{
		GameObject go = GameObject.Find ("Cylinder");
		if (ReferenceEquals (go, null)) {
			Debug.Log ("BBBB: failed to find Cylinder");
			return;
		}
		VideoSurface o = go.GetComponent<VideoSurface> ();
		o.mAdjustTransfrom += onTransformDelegate;
	}
```

##### Create the Transform Event Listener

The `onTransformDelegate()` delegate method detects transform changes for a `GameObject`.

- If `uid` is equal to `0` set the following `transform` properties:

Transform Property|Value|Description
---|---|---
`position`|`new Vector3 (0f, 2f, 0f)`|Transform position.
`localScale`|`new Vector3 (2.0f, 2.0f, 1.0f)`|Transform scale on the local level.
`Rotate`|`0f, 1f, 0f`|Transform rotation.

- Otherwise, set the rotate transform property to `0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f` using `transform.Rotate()`.

```
	// delegate: Adjust transform for game object 'objName' connected with user 'uid'.
	// You could save information for 'uid' (e.g. which GameObject is attached).
	private void onTransformDelegate (uint uid, string objName, ref Transform transform)
	{
		if (uid == 0) {
			transform.position = new Vector3 (0f, 2f, 0f);
			transform.localScale = new Vector3 (2.0f, 2.0f, 1.0f);
			transform.Rotate (0f, 1f, 0f);
		} else {
			transform.Rotate (0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);
		}
	}
```

#### Create User Event Listeners

The `HelloUnityVideo` class has three event listeners to manage users joining and leaving a channel.

##### Create the Join Success Event Listener

The `onJoinChannelSuccess()` event listener detects when the channel is successfully joined.

1. Set a debug log for the user's `uid` that joins the channel using `Debug.Log ()`.

2. Retrieve the `GameObject` with the name `VersionText` using `GameObject.Find()`.

3. Set the text for `textVersionGameObject.GetComponent<Text> ()` as the SDK version specified by `getSdkVersion ()`.

```
	private void onJoinChannelSuccess (string channelName, uint uid, int elapsed)
	{
		Debug.Log ("JoinChannelSuccessHandler: uid = " + uid);
		GameObject textVersionGameObject = GameObject.Find ("VersionText");
		textVersionGameObject.GetComponent<Text> ().text = "Version : " + getSdkVersion ();
	}
```

##### Create the Remote User Join Event Listener

The `onUserJoined()` event listener detects when a remote user joins the channel.

Set a debug log for the remote user's `uid` that joins the channel using `Debug.Log ()` and retrieve the `GameObject` with the name `uid.ToString()` using `GameObject.Find()`.

If `go` is `null`, set its `name` property to `uid.ToString ()` and create a new `VideoSurface` object using `go.AddComponent<VideoSurface> ()`. Apply the following to `o`.

1. Set the user ID using `o.SetForUser()`.
2. Add `onTransformDelegate` to the `mAdjustTransfrom` property.
3. Enable it by passing `true` into `o.SetEnable()`.
4. Set the `transform` property values `Rotate`, `position`, and `localScale`.

If `go` is not `null`, set `mRemotePeer` to `uid`.


```
	// When a remote user joined, this delegate will be called. Typically
	// create a GameObject to render video on it
	private void onUserJoined(uint uid, int elapsed)
	{
		Debug.Log ("onUserJoined: uid = " + uid);
		// this is called in main thread

		// find a game object to render video stream from 'uid'
		GameObject go = GameObject.Find (uid.ToString ());
		if (!ReferenceEquals (go, null)) {
			return; // reuse
		}

		// create a GameObject and assign to this new user
		go = GameObject.CreatePrimitive (PrimitiveType.Plane);
		if (!ReferenceEquals (go, null)) {
			go.name = uid.ToString ();

			// configure videoSurface
			VideoSurface o = go.AddComponent<VideoSurface> ();
			o.SetForUser (uid);
			o.mAdjustTransfrom += onTransformDelegate;
			o.SetEnable (true);
			o.transform.Rotate (-90.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
			float r = Random.Range (-5.0f, 5.0f);
			o.transform.position = new Vector3 (0f, r, 0f);
			o.transform.localScale = new Vector3 (0.5f, 0.5f, 1.0f);
		}

		mRemotePeer = uid;
	}
```

##### Create the User Offline Event Listener

The `onUserOffline()` event listener detects when a user goes offline.

1. Set a debug log for the user's `uid` that goes offline using `Debug.Log ()`.

2. Retrieve the `GameObject` with the name `uid.ToString()` using `GameObject.Find()`.

3. If `go` is `null`, destroy `go` by passing it into the `Destroy()` method.

```
	// When remote user is offline, this delegate will be called. Typically
	// delete the GameObject for this user.
	private void onUserOffline(uint uid, USER_OFFLINE_REASON reason)
	{
		// remove video stream
		Debug.Log ("onUserOffline: uid = " + uid);
		// this is called in main thread
		GameObject go = GameObject.Find (uid.ToString());
		if (!ReferenceEquals (go, null)) {
			Destroy (go);
		}
	}
```


### Create the Home Class

The `Home` class is a subclass of `MonoBehaviour`. The [`Home.cs`](Assets/Home.cs) file contains the relevant UI functionality for the Unity 3D sample application created in the [Create the Scenes](#create-the-scenes) section.


```
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;
using UnityEngine.UI;
using UnityEngine;

public class Home : MonoBehaviour {

	...

}
```

The remaining code in this section is contained within the `Home` class declaration.

- [Declare Initialization Methods and Variables](#declare-initialization-methods-and-variables)
- [Create Join / Leave UI Functionality](#create-join-leave-ui-functionality)
- [Create Event Listener](#create-event-listener)


#### Declare Initialization Methods and Variables

The `Start()` and `Update()` methods are empty method declarations and can be used for added initialization and update functionality.

```
	// Use this for initialization.
	void Start () {
	}

	// Update is called once per frame.
	void Update () {
	}
```

The `Home` class declares a single `HelloUnityVideo` object initialized to `null`. This object is used to reference the functionality in the class discussed in the [`HelloUnityVideo`](#create-the-hellounityvideo-class) section.

```
	static HelloUnityVideo app = null;
```

#### Create Join / Leave UI Functionality

The `onButtonClicked()` method is applied to the **JoinButton** and **LeaveButton** UI objects. This method determines if the user should join or leave the channel.

- If the button's `name` is `JoinButton`, invoke `onJoinButtonClicked()`.
- If the button's `name` is `LeaveButton`, invoke `onLeaveButtonClicked()`

**Note:** `JoinButton` and `LeaveButton` are the object names in the Unity scenes, not the actual display text shown to the user.

```
	public void onButtonClicked() {
		// which GameObject?
		if (name.CompareTo ("JoinButton") == 0) {
			onJoinButtonClicked ();
		}
		else if(name.CompareTo ("LeaveButton") == 0) {
			onLeaveButtonClicked ();
		}
	}
```

##### Create the Join Button Method

The `onJoinButtonClicked()` method is applied to the **Join** button object.

1. Retrieve the `ChannelName` using `GameObject.Find()`.
2. Declare a new `InputField` class using `go.GetComponent<InputField>()`.
3. If `app` is equal to `null`, create a new `HelloUnityVideo` class and load the Agora RTC engine using `app.loadEngine()`.
4. Join the channel specified by `field.text` using `app.join()`.
5. Add `OnLevelFinishedLoading` to the scene loading event listener `SceneManager.sceneLoaded`.
6. Load `SceneHelloVideo` using `SceneManager.LoadScene()`.

```
	private void onJoinButtonClicked() {
		// get parameters (channel name, channel profile, etc.)
		GameObject go = GameObject.Find ("ChannelName");
		InputField field = go.GetComponent<InputField>();

		// create app if nonexistent
		if (ReferenceEquals (app, null)) {
			app = new HelloUnityVideo (); // create app
			app.loadEngine (); // load engine
		}

		// join channel and jump to next scene
		app.join (field.text);
		SceneManager.sceneLoaded += OnLevelFinishedLoading; // configure GameObject after scene is loaded
		SceneManager.LoadScene ("SceneHelloVideo", LoadSceneMode.Single);
	}
```

##### Create the Leave Button Method

The `onLeaveButtonClicked()` method is applied to the **Leave** button object.

Ensure `app` is not `null` and execute the following:

1. Leave the channel using `app.leave()`.
2. Unload the Agora RTC engine using `app.unloadEngine()`.
3. Set `app` to `null`.
4. Load `SceneHome` using `SceneManager.LoadScene()`.

```
	private void onLeaveButtonClicked() {
		if (!ReferenceEquals (app, null)) {
			app.leave (); // leave channel
			app.unloadEngine (); // delete engine
			app = null; // delete app
			SceneManager.LoadScene ("SceneHome", LoadSceneMode.Single);
		}
	}
```

#### Create Event Listener

The `Home` class declares a single event listener `OnLevelFinishedLoading()` to detect when a scene has finished loading.

If the `scene.name` is `SceneHelloVideo`:

- Ensure `app` is not `null` and invoke `app.onSceneHelloVideoLoaded()` to tell the `HelloUnityVideo` that the scene finished loading.

- Remove the `OnLevelFinishedLoading` event listener from `SceneManager.sceneLoaded`.

```
	public void OnLevelFinishedLoading(Scene scene, LoadSceneMode mode) {
		if (scene.name.CompareTo("SceneHelloVideo") == 0) {
			if (!ReferenceEquals (app, null)) {
				app.onSceneHelloVideoLoaded (); // call this after scene is loaded
			}
			SceneManager.sceneLoaded -= OnLevelFinishedLoading;
		}
	}
```



## Some Trouble Shooting FAQs

**Q:** There are only white cube and box on the demo screen after I join the channel.
**A:** There may be definite reasons for this. First recommendation is implementing the OnError and OnWarning callbacks to check on what errors are occuring. (Added in the Demo starting from v3.2.1.71). Here are the common causes:

1. You registered an AppId with Certificate enabled, but you didn’t include a secure token in your JoinChannel call. => **You should use an AppId without Certificate if you are new to the SDK.** Create a new AppId with Certificate after you tested the POC and feel comfortable to enforce token security.

2. The Application did not acquire the required OS level permission for Camera. => **Make sure you set those up in the PlayerSettings and Manifest if for Android.**

3. The agoraCWrapper library didn’t get loaded on run-time (usually happens on Standalone, not Editor). Make sure you have the correct Platform Settings flag selected, we recommend you to select **AnyCPU**. See examples in MacOS section for building the App above.

   

**Q:** I press the join button but the scene doesn't change (usually happens on Editor).
**A:** Make sure you have chosen both two scenes in Build Settings.



**Q:** When run the app, a pop-up window said agoraSdkCWrapper.bundle cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.(usually happens on MacOS).
**A:** Choose "allow" in Settings/security and privacy, rerun the app.
